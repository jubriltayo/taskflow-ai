## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### 1. Code Generation
**Primary Tool: Cursor IDE**

**How AI will scaffold features:**
- Generate complete React components with TypeScript interfaces using natural language prompts
- Scaffold Prisma database models and migrations from plain English descriptions
- Create Next.js API routes with proper error handling, validation, and TypeScript types
- Generate shadcn/ui component compositions and layouts
- Auto-complete complex form validation schemas using Zod

**Custom Cursor Rules:**
```
- Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Use shadcn/ui components exclusively, avoid custom CSS
- Include proper error boundaries and loading states
- Generate accessible components with ARIA labels
- Follow React Server Component patterns where applicable
- Use Zod for all form validation and API input validation
```

### 2. Testing Support
**AI-Generated Test Strategy:**

**Unit Testing:**
- Generate comprehensive unit tests for utility functions and custom hooks
- Create test suites for form validation logic and data transformations
- Generate mock data factories for consistent testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Generate API route tests with realistic request/response scenarios
- Create database operation tests with Prisma mock integration
- Generate component integration tests using React Testing Library

**Sample AI Testing Prompts:**
- "Generate unit tests for task creation API route including validation errors, authentication checks, and database operations"
- "Create integration tests for the TaskCard component with user interactions, status updates, and delete functionality"

### 3. Schema-Aware & API-Aware Generation

**Database Schema Integration:**
- Feed complete Prisma schema to AI for generating type-safe CRUD operations
- Generate API route handlers that automatically match database constraints
- Create client-side hooks and utilities based on API endpoint specifications
- Auto-generate TypeScript interfaces from Prisma models for frontend consumption

**API-Aware Development:**
- Generate API client functions using OpenAPI specifications
- Create type-safe API utilities with proper error handling
- Generate form components that match API endpoint requirements
- Auto-generate API documentation from route handlers and schemas

**Context-Aware Techniques:**
- Provide file tree structure to AI for understanding project architecture
- Feed database schema context when generating related API routes
- Share component interfaces for consistent prop typing across the application
- Use git diffs in prompts for targeted code improvements and refactoring

### 4. Documentation Generation
**AI-Assisted Documentation Strategy:**

- Generate comprehensive inline code comments explaining business logic
- Create API documentation automatically from route handlers and schemas
- Generate component documentation with prop types and usage examples
- Auto-generate setup and deployment guides
- Create user guides and feature documentation

## üîß In-Editor & PR Review Tooling

### Primary Development Tool: Cursor IDE
**How it will support development:**
- Real-time AI code completion with project context awareness
- Natural language code generation for complex business logic
- Intelligent debugging suggestions and error resolution
- Context-aware refactoring recommendations
- Custom cursor rules enforcement for consistent code style

### PR Review Tool: CodeRabbit
**Integration and workflow:**
- Automated code review with security and performance insights
- AI-powered suggestions for code optimization and best practices
- Automated detection of potential bugs and logic errors
- Generation of detailed PR summaries and changelogs
- Automated commit message generation following conventional commit standards

### Workflow Integration:
1. Use Cursor for rapid development and prototyping
2. Create feature branches with descriptive AI-generated names
3. CodeRabbit reviews all PRs before merging to main branch
4. AI-generated commit messages following conventional commit format
5. Automated testing pipeline triggered by AI-identified critical changes

## üìù Prompting Strategy

### Sample Development Prompts:

**1. Component Generation:**
```
"Generate a TypeScript React Server Component for a task dashboard that displays a grid of tasks with filtering by status (todo, in-progress, completed) and priority (high, medium, low). Use shadcn/ui Card components, include loading states, empty states, and proper TypeScript interfaces. The component should be responsive and include accessibility features."
```

**2. API Route Creation:**
```
"Create a Next.js App Router API route for task management with the following operations: GET (fetch user tasks with filtering), POST (create new task), PATCH (update task status/priority), DELETE (soft delete). Include Zod validation, proper HTTP status codes, authentication middleware, and Prisma database operations. Return type-safe responses with error handling."
```

**3. Database Schema Design:**
```
"Design a Prisma schema for a task management app with Users, Tasks, and Categories. Tasks should have title, description, status (enum: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED), priority (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), due date, created/updated timestamps, and relationships to users and categories. Include proper indexing and constraints."
```

**4. Test Suite Generation:**
```
"Generate a comprehensive test suite for the task creation API route using Vitest. Include tests for: successful task creation, validation errors (missing fields, invalid enums), authentication failures, database connection errors, and rate limiting. Mock Prisma client and NextAuth session. Use realistic test data and edge cases."
```

**5. Form Component with Validation:**
```
"Create a task creation form component using React Hook Form, Zod validation, and shadcn/ui form components. Include fields for title (required, max 100 chars), description (optional, textarea), status (select dropdown), priority (radio buttons), and due date (date picker). Include proper error handling, loading states, and success feedback."
```
